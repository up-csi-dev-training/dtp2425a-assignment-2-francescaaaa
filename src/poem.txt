"On The Drive Home"

Released Aug. 12, 2022

Love, keep your eyes on the road
'Cause when I stare all I see is two foggy windows to a lost soul
And maybe, maybe it's all my fault
That it's so quiet on the drive home

Babe, can I build my home in your mind?
A disheveled maze, constellated and intertwined
But somehow, my favorite kind
And my favorite view
When it untangles in the moonlight

Darling, we're getting older
In less than eight months, you'll wash tear stains off of your shoulder
And drenched in alcohol and conceit
The cold-blooded bodies, quick on their feet
Will tell you how to earn your stripes

And you'll be listening while
I sit here with glistening eyes
As the stripes on my back chip and dry
You won't be listening to my cries
Anymore

And we'll be two pieces of driftwood
Floating in a sea of missed calls and excuses
And your home will change into four walls and a mini fridge
Instead of four limbs and lips to kiss

But for now, the night is young
And you are here and Snow Patrol just came on the radio
So darling, let's take
Darling, let's take the long way home

Love, keep your eyes on the road
